- Pattern Matching
- Variables (but not really)
- Function Clauses
- Modules

```
[frag=3]

---

## Modules

- Used for name-spacing/organization [frag=1]
- Level of code reuse [frag=2]
- Must match with filename [frag=3]
- Declaration is first line of file [frag=4]

---

## Modules

my_erlang_project/src/markov_chain.erl

```erlang
-module(markov_chain).
```

---

## Exports

- Preprocessor directive to declare API of a module [frag=1]
- List of function identifiers [frag=2]
- Multiple export declarations are allowed [frag=3]


---

## Exports

```erlang
-module(my_math).

-export([sum/1]).
```

---

## Exports

```erlang
%% API
-export([start_link/1,
         add_following_word/2,
         pick_next_word_after/1]).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1,
         handle_call/3,
         handle_cast/2,
         handle_info/2,
         terminate/2,
         code_change/3]).
```

---

## Functions

- Identified by name and arity (number of arguments)
- Allows for multiple function clauses
  - Uses pattern matching to match the clause
  - Order is important, first clause to match wins

---

## Functions

### Defining Functions

my_list.erl

```erlang
-module(my_list).

-export([sum/1]).

sum(List) ->
    sum(List, 0).

sum([], Sum) ->
    Sum;
sum([Head | Rest], Sum) ->
    sum(Rest, Sum + Head).
```

---

## Functions

### Calling a Function

```
my_list:sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]).
```

---

## Functions

### Unused Arguments

```erlang
some_function(_Head, []) ->
    ok;
```

---

# Markov Chains

---

## Markov Chain

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain
- Random state transitions based off current state and probabilities of next state.
- Similar to iPhoneâ€™s predictive typing

---

## Markov Chain

Priming the Markov Chain

- [frag=1] Parse out words
- [frag=2] Iterate over words, and create an association between a word and the word following it

---

## Markov Chain

Generating the Markov Chain

- [frag=1] Given a word, we want to pick from the next word by probability of occurance
- [frag=2] Keep picking words until we reach the number of words to generate

---

## Markov Chain

### Application Structure Overview

markov_app.erl
markov_sup.erl
markov_generator_sup.erl

```

---

# Code Time!

# OTP

---

## Why OTP?

OTP is a set of libraries for applying lessons learned in building distributed, asynchronous, concurrent applications with high availability

\#BuzzwordBingo [frag=1]

---

## But, First

---

## Actor Model

- [frag=1] No Shared State
- [frag=2] Message Passing
  - [frag=3] Asynchronous Communication

---

## Actor Model

Implemented via Erlang Processes [frag=1]

---

## Processes

- Cheap
- Isolated
- Message Passing
- Links and Monitors
- Garbage Collection

---

## Processes

### Cheap

Processes are not

- Platform Process
- Threads

---

## Processes

### Cheap

Processes are

- Green threads
- Managed by the Erlang Runtime
- Small
- Quick to create

---

## Processes

### Cheap

> Processes are not threads.  Processes are cheap.  Ommmmm.
>
> -- <cite>Martin J. Logan</cite>
---

## Processes

### Isolated Processes

- No shared state
- The only state they have access to is their own

---

## Processes

### Message Passing

- Mailboxes
- Messages
  - Must provide all the information a process would need
    - Includes "Return addresses"
- No View of outside world (mostly)
  - Process registry
- Asynchronous

---

## Processes

### Links and Monitors

- Monitors
  - Monitor status of another process
- Links
  - Process is dependent on another process

---

## Processes

### Garbage Collection

Processes live on their own, and don't share state, so easy to reclaim memory when process is no longer being used.

---

## gen_server

- [frag=1] Generic Server
- [frag=2] The base behavior other OTP behaviors are built on
- [frag=3] Takes care of the different concerns you would have to write yourself
  - [frag=4] Handles maintaining state in your processes
  - [frag=5] Allows for synchronous communication on top of asynchronous message passing

---

## gen_server

Implement a behavior and expected set of callbacks

```erlang
-behavior(gen_server).

%% gen_server callbacks
-export([init/1,
         handle_call/3,
         handle_cast/2,
         handle_info/2,
         terminate/2,
         code_change/3]).
```
[frag=1]

---

## gen_server

### init/1

```erlang
init(Args) -> {ok, State} |
              {ok, State, Timeout} |
              ignore |
              {stop, Reason}
```

---

## gen_server

### handle_call/3

```erlang
handle_call(Request, From, State) ->
                            {reply, Reply, State} |
                            {reply, Reply, State, Timeout} |
                            {noreply, State} |
                            {noreply, State, Timeout} |
                            {stop, Reason, Reply, State} |
                            {stop, Reason, State}
```

---

## gen_server

### handle_cast/2

```erlang
handle_cast(Msg, State) -> {noreply, State} |
                           {noreply, State, Timeout} |
                           {stop, Reason, State}
```

---

## gen_server

### handle_info/2

```erlang
handle_info(Info, State) -> {noreply, State} |
                            {noreply, State, Timeout} |
                            {stop, Reason, State}
```

---

## gen_server

### terminate/2

```erlang
terminate(Reason, State) -> void()
```

---

## gen_server

### code_change/3

```erlang
code_change(OldVsn, State, Extra) -> {ok, NewState}
```

---

## gen_server

### Calling a gen_server Synchronously

```
call(ServerRef, Request) -> Reply
call(ServerRef, Request, Timeout) -> Reply
```

---

## gen_server

### Calling a gen_server Asynchronously

```
cast(ServerRef, Request) -> ok
```

---

## gen_server

### Creating a API for you gen_server

- Why?
  - [frag=1] How would your client know your ServerRef?
  - [frag=2] What if you change your Request format?
  - [frag=3] All consumers would need to know format

---

## gen_server

### Creating a API for you gen_server

src/markov_word.erl

```
-export([add_following_word/2]).


add_following_word(Word, FollowingWord) ->
    WordPid = find_process_for_word(Word),
    gen_server:call(WordPid, {add_following_word,
                              FollowingWord}).
```

---

# Code Time!

- Generate a reference for a process for a word
- Start a process for a word seen
- Add following word to state of process

---

## Generate a reference for a word

### src/markov_word.erl

```
find_process_for_word(Word) ->
    WordKey = get_registered_name_for_word(Word),
    case whereis(WordKey) of
        undefined -> register_word(WordKey);
        Pid when is_pid(Pid) -> Pid
    end.
```

---

### src/markov_word.erl

```
add_following_word(Word, FollowingWord) ->
    WordPid = find_process_for_word(Word),
    gen_server:call(WordPid, {add_following_word,
                              FollowingWord}).
```

---

### src/markov_word.erl

```
pick_next_word_after(Word) ->
    WordPid = find_process_for_word(Word),
    gen_server:call(WordPid, {pick_next_word}).
```

---

### src/markov_word.erl

```
handle_call({add_following_word, Word}, _From,
             #state{following_words=FollowingWords}) ->
    NewState = #state{following_words=
                     add_word_to_list(FollowingWords, Word)},
    {reply, ok, NewState};
handle_call({pick_next_word}, _From,
            State=#state{following_words=FollowingWords}) ->
    Reply = pick_next_word(FollowingWords),
    {reply, Reply, State}.
```

---

## Starting a process for a word
```
start_link(WordKey) when is_atom(WordKey) ->
    gen_server:start_link({local, WordKey}, ?MODULE, [], []).
```

---

#Let it Crash!

## supervisor

### init - example

```erlang
init([]) ->
    RestartStrategy = simple_one_for_one,
    MaxRestarts = 1000,
    MaxSecondsBetweenRestarts = 3600,

    SupFlags = {RestartStrategy,
                MaxRestarts,
                MaxSecondsBetweenRestarts},

    Restart = permanent,
    Shutdown = 2000,
    Type = worker,

    Child = {markov_word, {markov_word, start_link, []},
                   Restart, Shutdown, Type, [markov_word]},

    {ok, {SupFlags, [Child]}}.
```

---

## supervisor

### restart strategies

- one_for_one
- one_for_all
